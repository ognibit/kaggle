A collection of my Kaggle competitions

## Titanic

My first try with Kaggle.
The submission accuracy is 77.75%, lower than the 80% I wanted.
I used it to practice with Pandas and Sklearn, and after some submissions I
stopped the improvement because it is no longer a valid approach.

Lesson learned

- Do the data analysis in two steps, a first one to understand the data types
  and they macro characteristics, and a second one to go deeper and fix issues.
- Be careful to spend time on every single feature until everything is clear.
- Write more text to record the insights.
- Collect in text previous results, they can be useful in the future.
- Analyze carefully the relation between the feature and the target.
- Do not submit until you cannot improve the validation accuracy.

Future improvements

- Build the pre-processing pipeline when you start the feature engineering.
- Improve the pre-processing to be applied easily both on train and test set,
  but remember that the parameters must be calculated on the train set.
- Find a way to enable/disable features to be able to test different setups
  also for the same feature.
